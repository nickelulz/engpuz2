\textit{You've already made it this far, so I must confess, I've been keeping great secrets from you. I broke up the truth into two parts and hid it in just the way you might expect, with the nuances of language. Take the number value of each excerpt from my diary and match it to the literary term.} \\

\section*{Excerpts}

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=main]
  \item \mi ``Henry didn’t answer. `What are you doing here?' he said in a very annoyed tone of voice. \psep `There’s a party today.' \psep `What?' \psep `A party. He’s there now.' I paused. `He’s not going to come.' \psep `See, I told you,' said Francis, aggrieved, stepping gingerly from the brush and wiping his hands. Characteristically, he was not dressed for the occasion and had on sort of a nice suit. `Nobody listens to me. I said we should have left an hour ago.' \psep \dots \psep Then—almost before I noticed it—they stopped, very near my back. \psep I glanced up and saw Charles. He was staring straight ahead with a ghastly expression on his face and I was on the verge of asking him what was the matter when, with a sick, incredulous rush of disbelief, I heard Bunny’s voice directly behind me. \psep `Well, I’ll be damned,' he said briskly. `What’s this? Meeting of the Nature Club?' \psep I turned. It was Bunny, all right, all six-foot-three of him, looming up behind me in a tremendous yellow rain slicker that came almost to his ankles." (pg. 265-268) \\
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=main]
  \item \mi ``But these are fundamentally \textit{sex} rituals, aren't they?' \psep It came out not as a question but as a statement. He didn't blink, but sat waiting for me to continue. \psep `Well? Aren't they? \psep He leaned over to rest his cigarette in the ashtray. `Of course,' he said agreeably, cool as a priest in his dark suit and ascetic spectacles. `You know that as well as I do.' \psep We sat looking at each other for a moment. \psep `What exactly did you do?' I said. \psep `Well, really, I think we needn't go into that now,' he said smoothly. `There was a certain carnal element into the proceedings but the phenomenon was basically spiritual in nature.'' (pg. 168) \\
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=main]
  \item \mi ``Not at all. Do you think, if he'd told anyone else, we'd be sitting here now? Do you think now, once he's told you, that he'd be foolhardy enough to tell a third party before he even knows what your response will be? Why do you suppose he called you this afternoon? Why do you suppose he's pestered the rest of us all day?' \psep I didn't answer him. \psep `Because,' said Henry, `he was testing the waters. Last night he was drunk, full of himself. Today he's not quite sure what you think. He wants another opinion. And he'll look to your response for the cue.'' (pg. 258) \\
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}[resume=main]
  \item \mi ``Being the only female in what was basically a boys’ club must have been difficult for her. Miraculously, she didn’t compensate by becoming hard or quarrelsome. She was still a girl, a slight lovely girl who lay in bed and ate chocolates, a girl whose hair smelled like hyacinth and whose scarves fluttered jauntily in the breeze. But strange and marvelous as she was, a wisp of silk in a forest of black wool, she was not the fragile creature one would have her seem. In many ways she was as cool and competent as Henry; tough-minded and solitary in her habits, and in many ways as aloof. Out in the country it was not uncommon to discover that she had slipped away, alone, out to the lake, maybe, or down to the cellar, where once I found her sitting in the big marooned sleigh, reading, her fur coat thrown over her knees. Things would have been terribly strange and unbalanced without her. She was the Queen who finished out the suit of dark Jacks, dark King, and Joker. (pg. 224)''

\textit{Once you've made your answer, put the order in which they are put into and combine them all into one number. (For example; 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 would become 12345.) Take this number, multiply it by your number from the crossword, and the first three digits of that are the combination code for the lock.}
